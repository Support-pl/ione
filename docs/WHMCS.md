## IaaS & VDC Provisioning

Our brand new module for billing and provisioning VDC users in OpenNebula, which allows you to create users in certain groups with VDC privileges, collect usage data and bill users based on it.
Two billing types are now supported: pay-as-you-go and reservation for x-days(debiting once in x days).
